        <p>
          As a company, we define corporate responsibility as looking beyond a
          strong bottom line to consider the impact of everything we do. It's
          about doing the right thing as a corporate citizen in today's global
          marketplace while successfully meeting business goals and objectives.
          We are committed to delivery the best quality, therefore, we take a
          sustainable approach to resources. This way our delicious ingredients
          taste even better.
        </p>
        <p>
          To us, corporate responsibility isn’t about a final destination; it’s
          about an ongoing journey. We know our policies and procedures will
          evolve and change as the landscape in which we do business evolves and
          changes.
        </p>
        <p>
          The better job we do at being responsible today, the better our
          business will be in the future. We know that from a pure business
          sense, it can help us manage risk, enhance employee morale and
          retention, strengthen brand loyalty, build goodwill in and strengthen
          the communities in which we operate and can directly affect the bottom
          line in terms of energy savings and waste reduction. We also know that
          it must be a way of thinking and fully embedded within our brand. That
          is why our approach is stakeholder-driven, focused on four key areas –
          Food, People, Environment and Corporate Governance.
        </p>
        <h1>OUR COMMITMENT TO FOOD - PRODUCT RESPONSIBILITY</h1>
        <p>
          For over 60 years, our restaurants have been serving high quality,
          great tasting and affordable food around the world. Our commitment to
          the food we serve is what defines us as a company and is at the center
          of our brand promise. Our brand promise empowers our guests to make
          educated choices in customizing their meals to fit their individual
          lifestyles.

        <h1>OUR COMMITMENT TO PEOPLE</h1>
        <p>
          We are dedicated to supporting and investing in our people –
          employees, franchisees, suppliers and restaurant guests – because they
          are the cornerstones of our business. We do all that we can to serve
          employees and guests alike. The BURGER KING McLAMORE℠ Foundation is
          but one way that we support our Burger King friends and family. In
          addition to the foundation, along with our franchisee community, we
          support numerous local and regional initiatives worldwide.
        </p>
        <p>
          We continue to distinguish ourselves from our competitors by being an
          exceptional employer. One of the ways that we accomplish this goal is
          by creating a culture that is Bold, Accountable, Meritocratic,
          Empowered and Fun.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bold represents our determination to approach every situation with
          dynamic, innovative thinking.
        </p>
        <p>
          Accountable means that we embrace the responsibility we have as a
          public company to deliver value for our shareholders and for our
          franchisees and to provide great service and products to our
          restaurant guests.
        </p>
        <p>
          Empowered says that we vest individuals with the power and control to
          achieve their goals whether that person is our colleague, our
          franchisee, our supplier or our restaurant guest.
        </p>
        <p>
          Meritocratic ensures that exemplary work reaps great rewards. And Fun
          exclaims that we work as a team and strive to make every Burger King
          touch point worldwide – more than 13,000 restaurants, our field teams
          and our Restaurant Support Centers – a place where people love coming
          to work every day.

        <h1>OUR COMMITMENT TO THE ENVIRONMENT</h1>
        <p>
          The ongoing global debate regarding the role of business in
          sustainability has highlighted many of the challenges and expectations
          among all businesses, including the quick-service restaurant industry.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our people are engaged and committed. Our teams actively research and
          develop ways to make changes that will positively impact the
          environment without compromising operational standards. For example,
          we know that recycling and waste management are two of our biggest
          environmental challenges. We remain committed to working with
          suppliers to find ways we can reduce, reuse and recycle.
        </p>
        <h1>OUR COMMITMENT TO CORPORATE GOVERNANCE</h1>

          top. The board sets the tone by promoting an ethical culture that
          respects and values all employees and stakeholders and encourages
          compliance with all laws and company policies. As a condition of doing
          business within the Burger King system, every approved vendor must
          comply with the Code of Business Ethics and Conduct for Vendors. We’ve
          partnered with, and received recognition from, a variety of
          organizations that share our dedication to being a good corporate
          citizen and improving our communities around the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          With thousands of restaurants and millions of guests around the world,
          we realize that even small changes we can make a big impact. By
          instituting best practices, and educating and working with our
          employees and our business partners, we will continue to take steps to
          make meaningful contributions to our communities around the globe.
