          possible, notice will be given of this down-time and store fronts will
          be kept open. An example of an update which will receive no notice is

        <h1>TERMS OF SALE</h1>
        <p>
          By placing an order, you are offering to purchase a product on and
          subject to the following terms and conditions. All orders are subject
          to availability and confirmation of the order price. Dispatch times
          may vary according to availability and subject to any delays resulting
          from postal delays or force majeure for which we will not be
          responsible. In order to contract with www.anoelacards.com you must be
          over 18 years of age and possess a valid credit or debit card issued
          by a bank acceptable to us. www.desserts.com retains the right to
          refuse any request made by you. If your order is accepted we will
          inform you by email and we will confirm the identity of the party
          which you have contracted with. This will usually be DESSERT LIMITED, a
          vendor on www.anoelacards.com or may in some cases be a third party.
          Where a contract is made with a third party www.desserts.com is not
          acting as either agent or principal and the contract is made between
          yourself and that third party and will be subject to the terms of sale
          which they supply you. When placing an order, you undertake that all
          details you provide to us are true and accurate, that you are an
          authorized user of the credit or debit card used to place your order
          and that there are sufficient funds to cover the cost of the goods.
          The cost of services may fluctuate. All prices advertised are subject
          to such changes.
        </p>
        <h1>OUR CONTRACT</h1>
        <p>
          When you place an order, you will receive an acknowledgement e-mail
          confirming receipt of your order: this email will only be an
          acknowledgement and will not constitute acceptance of your order. A
          contract between us will not be formed until we send you confirmation
          by e-mail that the goods which you ordered have been dispatched to
          you. Only those goods listed in the confirmation e-mail sent at the
          time of dispatch will be included in the contract formed.
        </p>
        <h1>PRICING AND AVAILABILITY</h1>
        <p>
          Whilst we try and ensure that all details, descriptions and prices
          which appear on this Website are accurate, errors may occur. If we
          discover an error in the price of any goods which you have ordered, we
          will inform you of this as soon as possible and give you the option of
          reconfirming your order at the correct price or cancelling it. If we
          are unable to contact you, we will treat the order as cancelled. If
          you cancel and you have already paid for the goods, you will receive a
          full refund. Delivery costs will be charged in addition; such
          additional taxes and charges are clearly displayed where applicable
          and included in the ‘Total Cost’.
        </p>
        <h1>PAYMENT</h1>
        <p>
          Upon receiving your order our payment processing partner may carry out
          a standard authorization check on your payment card to ensure there
          are sufficient funds to fulfil the transaction. Your card will be
          debited upon authorisation being received. The monies received upon
          the debiting of your card shall be treated as a deposit against the
          value of the goods you wish to purchase. Once the goods have been
          dispatched and you have been sent a confirmation email the monies paid
          as a deposit shall be used as consideration for the value of goods you
          have purchased as listed in the confirmation email. Payments may also
          be made to Anoela Limited bank account and you shall immediately send
          a copy of the evidence of payment to the appropriate contact
          information on the Website.
